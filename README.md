# IP address tracker solution

This is a solution for the Front-end Engineer Job application at Arkantum Labs.

## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See their own IP address on the map on the initial page load
- Search for any IP addresses or domains and see the key information and location

### Potential improvements

- Search Errors handling. Currently this is an extremly simple error handling that display a red border. A more appropriate form validation should be used. We could use Zod and build typed form.
- The `/api/location` endpoint is public. It should at least be domain restricted to avoid ipify api credit usage.
